📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having a brain stroke using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various health-related factors like age, hypertension, heart disease, and more. The model has been trained and evaluated, but it is not deployed.

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset was taken from [Kaggle].
Features include:
Age
Hypertension (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Heart Disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Avg Glucose Level
BMI
Smoking Status
Other relevant features
⚙️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)
Scikit-learn (for model training & evaluation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
🔍 Model Training & Evaluation
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
Model Used: [RandomForestClassifier]
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Best Model Performance: [0.9466737064413939]

Future Improvements
Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning.
Deploy the model using Flask, FastAPI, or a cloud service.
Improve feature selection for better predictions.
